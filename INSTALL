INSTALLATION NOTES FOR UMTS-TOOLS


_ Installation on POSIX platforms _

If you are using any decent POSIX distribution, you will find Perl in
a prepackaged form. You will also need to install the following Perl
modules:

 - Device::SerialPort
 - Config::General
 - Digest::HMAC
 - Crypt::Rijndael
 - File::Type
 - XML::Simple

If you want to make use of the Graphic User Interface (GUI), you will also
need to install these Perl modules:

  - Glib
  - Gtk2

_ Installation on WIN32 platforms _

1. Install Perl

You can get a good distribution of Perl for Win32 here:
http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/


2. Install the required Perl modules

To install the Perl modules required by umts-tools, simply run the batch
file "install-win32.bat" that is distributed with umts-tools.


3. Install support for Gtk2::Perl (optional, to make use of GUI)

First install the files needed to run Gtk2 on Windows by retrieving the
following file and extracting it to C:\

http://dev.jerryweb.org/dist/gtk2-win32-deps-2.4.14.zip

Now you need to make sure Windows looks for the libraries you have just
installed. To do so, go to the 'Control Panel', then 'System', and in the
'Advanced' tab, click on 'Environment Variables'. In the 'System variables'
view, make sure the PATH variable currently ends with a semi-colon (";") or
add one as necessary. Then add the following to the end of the PATH variable:

  C:\usr\bin;

If you use a proxy server to access Internet you will need to set the
HTTP_PROXY environment variable in order to retrieve Perl modules
from Internet.  To do so you would type from a command prompt:

set HTTP_PROXY=http://myuser:mypass@proxy.mydomain.org:80/

Finally, install the necessary Perl modules by typing the following commands
from the command prompt:

ppm install http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/ExtUtils-PkgConfig.ppd
ppm install http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/Glib-1080.ppd
ppm install http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/win32/ppm/Gtk2-1080.ppd
